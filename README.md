# MakeAthon-Project
## Swissport X ##

Me and four other colleagues from the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) in Olten developed a project for Swissport as part of the MakeAthon module.
The company needed a platform that would allow communication between airport staff and the reinforcement agent. 
We used our expertise in machine learning and knowledge engineering and combined the two to offer the company an efficient solution. 
Machine learning: Using the data set "LX2254.mp4", the objects in the video were identified and categorised into the appropriate fields using a grid. As soon as the employees are in the fields, the timer starts to record the time, and as soon as a person leaves the field, the time is stopped and assigned to the appropriate field. 
Knowledge engineering: In the meantime, rules have been set up to categorise the respective tasks of the employees. There is a certain causality between the tasks because they are performed in a certain order. 
By implementing the rules in machine learning and by implementing the Deepsort algorithm, it is possible to accurately identify the objects and possible delays. 
This model not only enables communication between the airport controller and the reinforcement agent, but also makes it possible to detect delays at an early stage, increasing the efficiency of the whole process.
